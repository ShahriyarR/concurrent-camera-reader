# Concurrent Camera Reader tutorial project repo

The repo for Youtube tutorial series about using Python asyncio with OpenCV to grab frames 
from multiple video cameras concurrently and show without lagging.

The primary focus of tutorials are - solving real-world concurrent programming problem using Python asyncio - so if you want to learn Python asyncio, you are in a right place...
